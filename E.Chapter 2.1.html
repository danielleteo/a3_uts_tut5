AM’s strawberry blonde bangs fall into her eyes as she shakes her head, a giddy smile stretching her baby pink lips. <b>“Still! What have you got planned? Oh, you always have the best ideas for the party!”</b> She leans forward, launching into a recollection of last year’s festivities.
<br>
<br>
The syncopated beats of her speech and flamboyant hand gestures tweak the corners of Ezri’s mouth upwards. The pounding in her head subsides briefly, and a genuine laugh slips past at AM’s dramatic reenactments. For all of her quirks, Ezri feels her gaze soften.
<br>
<br>
The young woman before her is almost unrecognisable next to the one who came hurtling into The Void two years ago. Although the sheer volume of her being, and frequency of questions remain unchanged, AM’s unbound energy and funds as the only daughter of a business mogul seemed to find an outlet in the position of a club VIP.
<br>
<br>
A small sense of pride cinches Ezri’s heart at the thought of her youngest Mod – along with a sliver of guilt for what is about to happen. 
<br>
<br>
Until her line of sight shifts to MK – one sly eye fixed on the drinks and the other on her – and she forces her expression to conceal its instinctive disgust. No doubt he’s running his mouth. She imagines scratching the slimy smile right off his face. 
<br><i>I’ll enjoy seeing you go down.</i>
<br>
<br>
AM’s tinkling laughter pulls her attention back to the one-sided conversation. <b>“And we were all waiting…watch–watshing…”</b> 
<br>
<br>
<b>“I know.”</b> Ezri’s focus is fixed on the timer overlay of her contacts, watching the seconds until the remedy takes effect. <i>Twenty, nineteen, eighteen…</i>
<br>
<br>
She relaxes as AM’s doe eyes begin to droop, along with MK’s and the rest of the Mods’. Their bodies slump onto the soft leather chaises, or scatter themselves amongst other things on the cool polished floor. Once the final sponsor is lulled beyond consciousness, Ezri rises, giving a roll of her neck.
<br>
<br>
<b>“Lock the room,”</b> she instructs the guard, delivering a sharp kick to MK’s side as she passes. Ezri reaches for the key strung above her sternum. <b>“Do <i>not</i> let them near the basement.”</b>
