The Towers of the Network run high, stretching into the night’s eternal fog. A permanent neon glow rims the vectors of the buildings, a testament to the unceasing pandemonium encased within.
<br>
<br>
On the 89th Floor, Jaz wanders out of The Void – squinting, as his eyes adjust to the absence of strobing lights, and the vacuum silence of the hallway. He follows the carmine walls and worn carpeted paths towards the Sky Bridge, connecting Towers Two and Three – two thirds of the most notorious establishments in the red-light district.
<br>
<br>
He pauses in front of the sliding doors, feeling uncharacteristically courteous, as he drafts a quick notice to pre-empt his arrival, sending it off with a twitch of his fingers.  
<br>
<br>
The fingerprint pad gleams as Jaz presses his thumb to the reader, the authorisation screen flickering before him before he is granted admission. With a slight smirk, then sigh, he steps through the doors, hoping to delay the all-too-swift trip to <i>The Golden Chalice</i>.
<br>

The moment his Oxfords click against the polished marble, Jaz tenses. Though no stranger to Avaire’s host of casinos – far from it, in fact – he scrunches his nose as he enters, attributing it to the gaudy décor and clouds of overpriced cologne that permeate the place; the undecipherable, lingering sensation in his chest is shoved aside for the time being.
<br>
<br>
Jaz flexes his fingers and rolls his neck, determined to restrain his attention to the task at hand. Steeling himself against the siren songs of slot levers, chips, and chimes of accounts filling up, he swallows, averting his gaze just as the miniscule light on his ring flashes green. Relieved for the distraction, he opens the message with a flick of his hand.
<br>
<br>
<div class="txtmsg">
Meet me at the cards table.

<br>
<br>
<b>“Bastard,”</b> Jaz mutters, making his way to the furthest end of the casino. 
<br>The infamous poker table lies vacant, its typical crowds thinned by the post-midnight rush, bare of any indication of the countless dollars and bouts of control surrendered mere hours before.
<br>
<br>
He takes a seat, drumming his fingers against the velvet surface.
<br>
<br>
There's an itch as he follows the dealer's hands — the cards moving like water between their fingers, shuffled, then placed neatly beside the stacks of chips, awaiting a player's bet.
<br>
<br>
A woman situates herself at the opposite end of the table, platinum hair curled in pristine waves atop her shoulders. Her sequined dress reflects the sparse, warm lights of the corner onto the table, glinting nearly as bright as the teeth beneath her vulpine smile.
<br>
<br>
The dealer turns toward him. "In or out, sir?"
