Smoke curls lazily from her lips as she surveys her domain, seated amongst the Mods in the Throne.
<br>
<br>
No exception to any other night, the highest floor of The Void is packed.
<br>
<br>
Minimally clad bodies press against one another, drinks flow fast and freely, while tabs reach their high, a poetic mirror of their far-gone owners.
<br>
<br>
Her eyes flick across to the bar as she takes another drag, prompted by her second-in-command. They fall upon a mess of dark hair, frantic amidst the mass of glazed patrons, yelling over the din of a tuneless song.
<br>
<br>
Nex shoots her a look in question, but she gives a stiff shake of her head. Not a strand of long, black hair moves out of place as she rises. The leather clings to her tan skin in protest, but she pulls herself from the lounge, briefly straightening the hem of her dress before descending the platform.
<br>
<br>
She feels the eyes of those in the Throne follow her figure, wrapped in a black dress severed mid-thigh. The thin straps taut around her chest and back only sharpen the edges of her frame.

The striking of heels against the concrete plays a mere accompaniment to the noise of the club, as Ezri winds her way towards the bar. It is within earshot when she discerns the words – or rather, word – spilling from her target's mouth: one that violates the most important rule of The Void.
<br>
<br>
She storms the remaining distance, snapping a finger in front of his face.
<br>
<br>
The young man turns around, expression painted with an odd mix of surprise and relief. He opens his mouth to repeat the infraction when she silences him with a hand.
<br>
<br>
<b><i>"One rule,"</i></b> she grates out.
<br>
<br>
Through the lens of her contacts, his dark eyes register as neither bloodshot nor glassy, instead, piercing her own with painful clarity. 
<br>
<br>
The Facial Recog confirms a lack of matches, but the strange intensity to his gaze exhibits none of the bewilderment of a stranger's. 
<br>
<br>
His soft features knot together, unsure and hesitant, as he scans her face. Apart from his all-black attire of cargo pants and harnessed fixtures, he could have been any of the club’s regulars. 
<br>
<br>
Ezri feels the weight of the Mods' eyes settle on her shoulders, anticipating her next move.
