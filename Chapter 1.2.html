<b>"Hey, Boss."</b>
<br>
<br>
Jaz struts into the room, wearing his signature suit and grin.
<br>
<br>
<b>"Heard we had a name-caller."</b> 
<br>
<br>
He flashes his teeth in wolfish fashion, the boyish façade overturned, as he sinks into the plush leather seat.
<br>
<br>
Nex glances over at Jaz, no more disdain than usual in the look. 
<br>
<br>
<b>"She threw him out,"</b> he says, voice low, as Ezri scrawls the serial number on a slip and slides it towards him. <b>"Physically."</b> 
<br>
<br>
Jaz cards a hand through his messy golden locks, making a face as if scalded by hot water.
<br>
<b>"Bet that did not go down well for him."</b>
<br>
<br>
The apparent sympathy dissolves into a chuckle. <b>"So, what will it be this time, Boss? A little shake-and-snatch, maybe some light torture?"</b>
He waggles his eyebrows.
<br>
<br>
Ezri rolls her eyes but lets the corner of her mouth lift slightly. 
<br><b>"Talk to the usual suspects. <i>Especially</i> Avon,"</b> she adds when Jaz opens his mouth to protest. 
<b>"I want to know why our <i>guest</i> was here tonight."</b>
<br>
<br>
Jaz gives a huff, mumbling, <b>"Probably just some low-grade troublemaker."</b>
<br>
<br>
Ezri crosses her arms. <b>"Nex and I will split the earnings then."</b> 
<br>
<br>
Jaz jumps out of his seat. <b>"What do you mean?"</b>
<br>
<br>
Her eyes widen, a look of innocence if not for the curl of her lips. 
<br>
<br>
<b>"Let's just say the sooner you get me my information, the sooner we can lighten the load of his pockets."</b>
<br>
<br>
A winning grin stretches the edges of his mouth. <b>"You got it, Boss."</b> 
He's halfway out the door before he halts and turns around.
<br>
<br>
<b>“We haven’t had a name-caller in a while, huh?”</b>
<br>
<br>
The second-in-command rolls his eyes, muttering about how rules indeed <i>aren't</i> made to be broken, while Ezri merely laughs.
<br>
<br>
She taps her heel against the floor, adding to the thundering bass of the club beneath. <b>People want to be <i>free,</i> not reminded of their empty little lives."</b>
<br>
<br>
He shrugs in agreement. <b>"Still...bit harsh, don't you think?"</b>
<br>
<br>
<b>"I suggest you find the man whose hands I want to cut off – instead of tempting me to take a pair in closer proximity."</b> Her gaze lands pointedly on his ringed fingers.
<br>
<br>
Jaz holds his palms up in surrender, backing out towards the door. <b>"Alright, alright. Point taken, Boss..."</b> 
<br>
<br>
Then, from behind Nex, he whispers, <b>"Don't miss me too much!"</b>
<br>
<br>
<b>“I heard that,”</b> Nex grinds out, grumbling something about wishing he couldn’t, as he fiddles with his Amplifier. 
<br>
<br>With a quiet yelp, Jaz scurries out of the office before Nex can act on the deadly look he shoots.

<br>
<b>"I'll keep tabs on him,"</b> Nex reassures her, eyes shifting to the doorway, where jaunty footsteps echo down the hall. Ezri gives an absent-minded nod. 
<b>"The system is running the serial number and I'll pull the security feeds."
<br>
<br>
"Anything else?"</b> Nex asks, quiet, when she doesn't respond.
<br>
<br>
A crease appears in the space between her brows as she settles behind her desk.
<br>
<br>
<b>"No"</b>—Ezri presses a finger to her temple—<b>"I just need a moment – a drink – before I deal with the Mods."</b>
<br>
<br>
He nods, drifting over to the decanter to pour her usual. The glass is set before her. Nex takes his leave without another word.
