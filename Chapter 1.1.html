<b>"No names,"</b> she hisses, <b>"yours or anyone else's."</b> 
<br>
<br>
Reaching over, she gives a rough swipe of the silver band around his wrist. 
<br>
Without a chance to protest, his account balance appears, the numbers travelling well into six figures. 
<br>
<br>
Ezri makes note of the serial number at the edge. <i>149907.</i>
<br>
She flicks the holographic screen aside and turns on her heel, when he grasps her by the forearms, spinning her around to face him once more.
<br>
<br>
<b>"Eika? Eika, you need to leave – go home. They're coming."</b>
<br>
<br>
She rips his grip from her skin; one hand seizing the collar of his shirt, the palm of the other striking his cheek, leaving a red-hot mark in its wake.
<br>
<br>
<b>"Now, listen here,"</b> she says, drawing him closer by her hold on the fabric. <b>"I don't know how much they offered you to come in and cause trouble, but you’ll pay for it."</b> 
<br>
<br>
She gives a grin more startling than her shove, which sends him staggering backwards, as she nods to a guard by the door. <b>"Consider it a warning."</b>
<br>
<br>
Ezri strides back to her seat, unflinching as he calls the name again, cut off mid-scream by the guard's hand over his mouth as he's hauled out the exit.<br>

Nex stands as she re-joins them, falling into place at her side. His shoulder brushes hers, the leather of his jacket coarse. He holds out a cigarette. 
<br>
Ezri takes it between her teeth with a sigh, drawing a deep breath as he lights the tip.
<br>
<br>
<b>"Get Jaz. We've got some hunting to do."</b>
