<h2> Project Overview </h2>
<div class="maintext">
My artefact includes a website that hosts an interactive story – designed using HTML, CSS and JavaScript – as well as additional information about the project itself. The interactive fiction, The Void, encapsulates the commodification and obscurity of digital and social media, focusing on the addictive and intrinsically engineered aspects which serve the economic purposes of Big Data and Big Social – particularly in relation to the Attention Economy and platform society. 

<br>
<br>

Players navigate a largely text-based, web interface, and make a series of choices that inform their experience and various outcomes. They are presented with the prologue and first chapter of the story before being given the choice of continuing the narrative from the point of view of three distinct characters. This is executed through the integration of in-game statistics, utilising the collection of data as both a code and narrative device.

<br>
<br>

The player’s agentic power, afforded through a series of choices and decisions in the story, demonstrates the simultaneous freedom yet restricted autonomy they possess in influencing the story’s outcome – reflecting the ways in which new media provide unparalleled opportunity, though at the expense of users’ ability to exercise control over their data and, increasingly, lives.

<h2> Current State </h2>
<div class="maintext">
The project’s current state is incomplete, but largely functional. The scope of the interactive narrative spans a short, introductory prologue, the first chapter as a common strand, and the second chapter told from the perspectives of three different characters. The game currently runs until part of the second chapter for all three characters. 

In the bottom navigation bar, I aimed to include a ‘save’ function to enable players to keep their progress and a ‘load’ function to resume where they left off. However, due to time constraints and my limited experience with JavaScript, I was unable to fully implement this feature. The Stats page is also incomplete according to my plans, which was intended to display data from the player’s choices to depict the specific characteristics obtained and have an influence on the narrative arc. The Characters page provides information on the characters which the player encounters throughout the game.

<h2> Code and Data Literacy </h2>
<div class="maintext">
My literacy in code and data was strengthened both theoretically and practically, through the study of conceptual frameworks surrounding data and code, and applying these to creating a website. Through an exploration of code as power (Susskind, 2018) and the extensive influence of Big Data and Social as significant actors within surveillance capitalism (Zuboff, 2020), my understanding of the inherent link between code and data was expanded, and subsequently reproduced in the interactive fiction.  

<br>
<br>

Conceptually, The Void investigates the social and political implications of the networked technologies enabled by code and data, while being built self-reflexively on data and code itself. It invites players to question their role and personal experience within the Attention Economy and platform society (Djick et al., 2018), addressing issues such as algorithmic obscurity and surveillance capitalism, to challenge the ways in which these operate and influence our lives. Interactivity is a crucial element in elucidating the reality of these powerful forces in our everyday lives, providing players with an insight into the human and non-human actors that perpetuate the system (Djick et al., 2018, p.1). Moreover, the intended collection of data through player choices accords with the constant surveillance and monitoring users are subjected to within the platform society, as Djick et al. (2018) express that “[w]ith each mouse click and cursor movement user data are generated, stored, automatically analyzed, and processed” (p.3). 

<br>
<br>

Initially, I planned on using a program called Twine, which is specifically designed for interactive stories, but I wanted to challenge myself to improve my knowledge and understanding of HTML, CSS and JavaScript by writing the code myself. Additionally, I found it was easier to find reliable sources of assistance for HTML than Twine. 

<br>
<br>

With the help of online resources like W3Schools and Stackflow Exchange, I was able to familiarise myself with HTML to construct a webpage, exercising control over its visual appearance by primarily modifying CSS files. I learned to use the 'div class' tags to customise specific aspects of the interface and design, and distinguished between the applicability of 'div class' to multiple elements and 'div id' to singular ones. Furthermore, a fundamental understanding of JavaScript enabled me to embellish the webpage through the use of various functions. Initially, JavaScript was confusing due to the difference in the notation compared to HTML and CSS. I discovered that the ‘ } ’ bracket should only be included when closing a function – rather than after each instruction, tag or element, such as the '/div' after 'div class' in HTML. With my tutor’s assistance, I combined different JavaScript functions to create a typewriter effect for text, specified to occur after the previous line appeared, and was subsequently followed by a button. Moreover, I was taught to recognise the value of having different JavaScript files for pages requiring distinct functions to prevent unknown errors from occurring.

<br>
<br>

I also gained a deeper understanding of JavaScript’s syntax using W3Schools tutorials, including how to name functions using typical notation, ‘myFunction()’, and implementing a variety of instructions within them – such as defining variables, displaying them, and executing if-then statements. The most challenging aspect I encountered in working with JavaScript was during my attempt to construct a ‘save’ and ‘load’ function. I experimented over an extended period of time with different methods, wherein I attempted to record and store the URL of the user’s current webpage using the ‘save’ button, then retrieve it and direct the user to that link with the ‘load’ button. I made several attempts with JQuery as well, though I was still in the process of comprehending it. From my research, I concluded that it might only be possible if the variable was global rather than local, or specified as an object property before being called. While this aspect remained incomplete, I developed a greater understanding of the way in which JavaScript functions and variables operate in relation to one another.

<br>
<br>

Finally, coding a website with multiple pages reinforced the importance of appropriately naming and organising the elements, as well as adding comments, so they are easily amended and modified along the way. The process also required considerable forethought to ensure the code was as clean as possible, maximising common functions and classes to execute the intended actions. Overall, my code literacy developed significantly over the course of the subject, where I progressed from a lack of understanding of HTML, CSS and JavaScript to create a mostly-functioning artefact.
