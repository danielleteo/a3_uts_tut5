The bass pounding through the Throne tightens the iron vice on her skull, digging its claws into the bone and whittling away the remnants of coherent thoughts. 
<br>
<br>
She locates the Mods lounging on the white leather chaises, huddled amongst themselves.
<br>
They whisper conspiratorially – or perhaps she only imagines the silence that falls as her heels click in approach. 
<br>
<br>
<b>“Ezri.”</b> The Mod splits his mouth into a grin. <b>“We were wondering if you would be returning after the…fiasco.”</b> MK’s lip curls.
<br>
<br>
<i>Ugh.</i> <b>“Of course.”</b> Her smile is equal parts teeth and tongue. <b>“I wouldn’t dream of letting a minor inconvenience ruin our celebration. After all, it’s barely past three.”</b> 
<br>
<br>
She gestures for another round of drinks to be served, the glass walls darkening at her command. 
<br>
<br>
<b>“A toast.”</b> Ezri takes a flute from the platter and raises it. The transparent room suspended in the centre of The Void transforms itself into a black box. <b>“To the eve of our 7th anniversary!”</b>
<br>
<br>
<b>“To the eve!”</b> the Mods echo, downing the glasses one by one. 
<br>
<br>
Her lips kiss the rim, impressing a garnet stain. A languid smile takes its place as Ezri drops into a seat and easy conversation, stretching her arm over the top of the lounge to tip the untouched liquid into a potted plant. Ezri sets her alibi on a nearby table, nodding along to the words of her companions.
<br>
<br>
<b>“Can you believe it’s been seven years?”</b> AM exclaims, golden bangles jingling in excitement.
<br>
The fuschia sequins on her dress refract the strobing lights – so sharply that Ezri tilts her head, vision just grazing the milky curve of her cheek. Blissfully oblivious, AM flashes an equally blinding beam. 
<br>
<br>
Ezri chuckles. <b>“We haven’t been here <i>all</i> seven years.”</b>
