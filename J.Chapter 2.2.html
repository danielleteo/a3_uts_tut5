Best to keep a clear head. He should be here anytime now.
<br>
<br>
The straggle of patrons gives him a clear view of his expected guest, though he still jumps a little at the large hand that claps his shoulder from behind.
<br>
<br>
<b>"Now, Jaz, not playing dirty, are we?"</b> The words are followed by a self-indulgent laugh. Avon rounds the table, flicking a dismissive hand towards the dealer, before dropping into the seat next to Jaz with a thump.
<br>
<br>
<i>He looks a right crook,</i> Jaz thinks, rolling his eyes and fixing a glare at the man's smug grin. The light, dirty-blond stubble spattered across his chin, along with the unsettling glint in his murky green eyes, paints the poster image of a conman.
<br>
<br>
The scowl on Jaz's face, however, only widens the taunting smile.
<br>
<br>
<b>"It <i>is</i> still Jaz, isn't it?"</b> he continues when Jaz gives no response, <b>"With the one 'z'?"</b>
<br>
<br>
Jaz considers responding with his hands, though the crude reminder that his lean physique doesn’t prove much of an advantage stops him short.
<br>
<br>
The casino head takes the silence as an answer in the affirmative. <b>"Hah, figures."</b>
<br>
<br>
Jaz's tongue fires back before he can think to restrain it. <b>"It's still Avon, right? A for Asshole?"</b>
<br>
<br>
Avon narrows his eyes, dull in comparison to the acerbic emerald of Jaz's.
<br>
<br>
<b>"Watch yourself,"</b> he hisses. Jaz rolls his eyes but resigns any further jabs.
<br>
<br>
<b>"Why send your man to pay us a visit? If you wanted to see me, you <i>could</i> just call."</b> The sarcasm and underlying threat drip off the sentence, but Avon only gives a dry chuckle.
<br>
<br>
<b>"Don't flatter yourself."</b> He shoots Jaz a pointed look, then directs his gaze not-so-subtly to the watch on his wrist. <b>"If we had any business, you would know. I don't send lackeys to collect my dues."</b>
